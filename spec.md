# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a hamburger menu button to the right side of the app header that toggles a slide-in menu panel.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a ☰ hamburger icon button on the right side of the header in App.tsx, styled to match the existing dark/neon-green theme
- Implement toggle logic so clicking the button opens and closes a menu panel (side drawer or dropdown)
- Menu panel includes placeholder navigation items such as "Calculator" and "History"

**User-visible outcome:** Users see a hamburger menu button on the right of the header; clicking it opens a themed menu panel with placeholder items, and clicking again closes it.

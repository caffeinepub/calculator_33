  "summary": "The diff correctly implements REQ-1 by modifying CalculatorKeypad.tsx to have exactly one '=' button placed at the bottom-right of the last row (row 7), with row 6 containing only '1, 2, 3' (no '=' button). The layout comment and KEYPAD_ROWS array confirm the single '=' placement. No backend logic or history functionality was changed.",

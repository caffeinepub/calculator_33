  "summary": "The diff fully implements REQ-1. A new HamburgerMenu component was added in frontend/src/components/HamburgerMenu.tsx and integrated into the App.tsx header on the right side. It is styled with the neon-green dark theme, toggles a slide-in dropdown panel, supports closing via button click, and includes placeholder items (Calculator, History, About). No constraints were violated.",

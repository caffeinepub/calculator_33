  "summary": "The diff implements the core REQ-1 requirement by adding a `formatDivisionResult` function in Calculator.tsx that uses `toFixed(10)` and strips trailing zeros, applying it to division results. The implementation covers whole numbers (no trailing zeros), short decimals (exact precision), and long/repeating decimals (up to 10 places). The file summaries confirm the fix applies to both live preview and confirmed result display paths, and that history entries reflect the full precision value. Other operations are unaffected. All acceptance criteria appear to be addressed.",
